North Carolina State University - ECE 563 - Microprocessor Architecture

High Level Overview

o Programmed a simulator using C++ that mimicked the actions of a level one and two cache, fetching load and stores instructions sent from validation runs, and bringing them down from main memory.
o Implemented a prefetch unit that would use multiple stream buffers to fetch new instructions to lower miss rates.
o Compiled a report that demonstrated the mispredictions rates, energy consumption, and AAT for various level 1 and level 2 cache configurations. Configuration changes included blocksize, cache size, associativity, and prefetching.

File Descriptions 

Sim.h - header file that includes all important cache interface functions and variables.

Cache.cc - cpp file that includes the cache initilization, cache function implementations, and trace interactions.
